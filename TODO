BUGS

 * add: img = tf.keras.applications.vgg16.preprocess_input(img) !!!
 * -rd none, still calls pca in loading!

ANALYSE

 * check the different PCA solvers (for speed)
 * check the skCUDA (for fast PCA)

INPUT

 * CSV input

CACHING

 * external cache dir (instead of caching in the source dir)
 * trained PCA weights caching
 * caching of clustered csv (PRIORITY)
 * write metric only after writting results

VISUALIZATION

 * remove html output, instead add impage and wrapper script for imclust->impage
 * add select button into every cluster in overview, to generate "copypaste" export list
 * add the "last" button into every image in cluster view, to mark the tail of images to be recycled

PARALLELIZATION

 * the process needs to be separated into independent tools for perception,redim,etc. (BIG)
 * these have to be wrapped into parallelizing perl script!

EVAL

 * metrics in user specified space (embeddings) !!!
 * histogram of clusters sizes
