PCA

 * check the different PCA solvers (for speed)
 * check the skCUDA (for fast PCA)

CACHING

 * caching of clustered csv
 * trained PCA weights caching

EVAL

 * metrics in user specified space (embeddings) !!!
 * histogram of clusters sizes

PARALLELIZATION

 * the process can be separated into independent tools for perception,redim,etc.
 * these can be wrapped into short parallelizing (perl) script

VISUALIZATION

 * maybe remove html output, instead add impage and wrapper script for imclust->impage
 * add select button into every cluster in overview, to generate "copypaste" export list
 * add the "last" button into every image in cluster view, to mark the tail of images to be recycled
