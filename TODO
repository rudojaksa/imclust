CACHING

 * caching of clustered csv (PRIORITY)
 * automatic names for csv: resnet50-pca512-km128-tsp.csv (PRIORITY)

VISUALIZATION

 * remove html output, instead add impage and wrapper script for imclust->impage
 * add select button into every cluster in overview, to generate "copypaste" export list
 * add the "last" button into every image in cluster view, to mark the tail of images to be recycled

PARALLELIZATION

 * the process needs to be separated into independent tools for perception,redim,etc. (BIG)
 * these have to be wrapped into parallelizing perl script!

EVAL

 * histogram of clusters sizes
